:warning: Work in progress

This project is a light Python script to check automatically the availibility if TGV-max (MAX JEUNES) trains. 
Requests are scrapped from a google spreadsheet and send to the official SNCF API (https://data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/tgvmax/api/). The spreadsheet is then updated with the number of available free trains.

## todo list
- [ ] add Discord bot link support instead of playing a song on local when a train is found
- [ ] add a way to run the script on a remote machine in background
